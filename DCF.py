                For certain types of companies, especially high-growth tech firms, the valuation can be less accurate due to factors not explicitly modeled here, such as:
                - **Stock-Based Compensation (SBC):** High SBC can depress Net Income, leading to an artificially low "Owner Earnings" calculation and a lower valuation.
                - **Heavy Reinvestment:** Companies aggressively investing for future growth may show low or negative free cash flow, even if they are fundamentally healthy.
